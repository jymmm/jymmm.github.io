Flipping The Bird

Have a recue bird (Cockatiel) with arthritis that will flip over on it's back and can't turn itself over.
The idea is to put a very lightweight (&lt;20g) wifi module that can sense when upside down and send an alarm
to one or more receivers, be they dedicated hardware or smartphones, etc in a reliable manner.
